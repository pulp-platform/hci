# Repository content
The `hci` repository contains the definition of the Heterogeneous Cluster Interconnect (HCI) interfaces used with HWPEs (HW Processing Engines), as well as the IPs necessary to manage the streams and construct streamers, used in all recent (2019-ongoing) PULP platform HWPEs, e.g.:
 - https://github.com/pulp-platform/rbe
 - https://github.com/pulp-platform/ne16
 - https://github.com/pulp-platform/neureka
 - https://github.com/pulp-platform/redmule

# Style guide
These IPs use a slightly different style than other PULP IPs. Refer to `STYLE.md` for some indications.

# References
If you are using HCI IPs for an academic publication, we recommend citing one or more of the following papers, which describe several aspects of the HCI system:

# HCI Verification Environment

This repository also contains an environment for verifying the Heterogeneous Cluster Interconnect (HCI)

## Setup Instructions

Before running the simulation, follow these steps:

1. **Configure HCI Parameters** <br>
Edit the 'hci_config' file inside the config folder and insert the correct configuration values as needed for your verification environment. <br>  

2. **Run Setup**
```bash
make setup
```  
3. **Configure the Parameters of the Masters** <br>
Edit the files in the folder /config/hardware_config/masters_config to set the parameters of the masters  

4. **Choose the Test** <br>
Choose the test in /config/config.mk  

5. **Create stimuli** <br>
```bash
make stimuli
```  

6. **Run the simulation** <br>
```bash
make clean build run &
```
